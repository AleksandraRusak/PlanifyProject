# PlanifyProject
About the app "Planify":
ToDo app using Kotlin (.xml).
The user can register, log in, and log out.
They can add, edit, and delete todo items.
The user can choose a random profile picture.

I have used Fragments and Navigation Graph in the app. I have also used Firebase Auth to create new users and Room Database to store user information. An API is used to select a profile picture. RecyclerView - ListAdapter is an adapter used with RecyclerView, which is ideal for handling dynamically updated lists.
ViewModel is a lifecycle component used to separate an app's data from its view. I have used LiveData.
